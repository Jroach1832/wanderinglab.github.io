## Support Material for Masters Students
### Motivations:
Masters students lack time and breadth of exposure when compared to PhD's. While the web drowns in one page tutorials, there are some phenomenal resources for getting a real top notch education from the best researchers.  Here I've tried to curate some of the best into topics I've seen my students struggle with.

I like to think of these as a quilt.  With multiple renditions of topics by different professors woven together.
