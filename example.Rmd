```{r setup, include = F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = F, message = F, dev = "svg", fig.align = "center", cache = F)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy = T)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = '#>')
library("reticulate")
```

Here is an example blog post.

```{python}
import numpy as np

x = np.arange(44).reshape(11,4)
print(x)
```

We can also sneakily print python objects in R

```{r}
xx = as.data.frame(py$x)
xx
```

And grab R objects in python

```{r}
yy = 2* xx
```

```{python}
print(r.yy)
```

And we can also import between languages

```{r}
sklearn = reticulate::import("sklearn")
rf = sklearn$ensemble$RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators = 100)
rf
```
