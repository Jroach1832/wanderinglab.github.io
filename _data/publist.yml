- title: "Using Machine Learning for Antimicrobial Resistant DNA Identification"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: In this paper, we present a novel machine learning-based methodology for identifying bacteria DNA sub-sequences that are associated with antimicrobial resistance. The dramatic rise in cases of antibiotic resistant bacteria has been an increasing threat across the globe as the existing treatments are rendered ineffective in treating most of these cases due to mutations of their DNA. Among the most recent bacteria to display antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is Neisseria Gonorrhea with the first global treatment failure taking place in 2016. In 2018, new cases of resistance to multiple, high levels of antibiotics were reported in the United Kingdom and Australia. Timing is of the utmost importance when treating individuals who may have antimicrobial resistant infections and slowing their spread. It also is critical in identifying whether a patient has an antimicrobial infection to avoid unnecessarily prescribing antibiotics which may decrease their effectiveness in later treatments. Using machine learning, we are able to quickly and accurately identify cases of antimicrobial resistance as well as the adaptations to antibiotics.

- title: "sEMG Gesture Recognition with a Simple Model of Attention"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: Myoelectric control is one of the leading brain-machine-interfaces in the field of robotic prosthetics. We present our research in real-time surface electromyography (sEMG) signal classification, where our simple and novel attention-based approach now leads the industry, universally beating more complex, state-of-the-art models. Our model achieved an accuracy of 87\%(class-balanced accuracy: 69\%) using sEMG data and 91\%(balanced accuracy 74\%) using both sEMG and accelerometer (IMU) data on NinaPro DB5, as well as 73\% overall on NinaPro DB4, an improvement on both highly sophisticated deep learning and signal processing approaches. Notably, the representation of the data learned by the attention mechanism alone is powerful enough to yield an accuracy of 79\% on DB5. NinaPro DB5 is a standard benchmark for sEMG gesture recognition and consists of 53 unique gestures, including finger gestures, wrist gestures, and functional grasping gestures. Our proposed methodology's model simplicity represents a compelling alternative to the convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches utilized in recent research.

- title: "Forecasting Power Consumption in Pennsylvania During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A SARIMAX Model with External COVID-19 and Unemployment Variables"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: In this paper, we present how electrical consumption can reveal insight into the novel COVID-19 pandemic spread. We analyze electrical power consumption provided by PPL Electric Utilities, Department of Labor’s unemployment claims, and the COVID-19 cases/deaths for the State of Pennsylvania to study the impact of the pandemic on the infrastructure. Using a SARIMA model as our benchmark and we analyzed the use of a SARIMAX model to forecast the power consumption in Pennsylvania 14 days ahead. Our work quantifies and illuminates the effect that the strict legislation passed to minimize the spread of COVID19 had a on power consumption. Most importantly, this study helps drive a greater understanding into the hidden cost of a global pandemic such as COVID-19.

- title: "Compressed DNA Representation for Efficient AMR Classification"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: In this paper, we explore a representation methodology for the compression of DNA isolates. Using lossless string compression via tokenization of frequently repeated segments of DNA, we reduce the length of the isolates to be counted as k-mers for classification. With this new representation, we apply a previously established feature sampling method to dramatically reduce the feature space. In understanding the genetic diversity, we also look at conserving biological function across these spaces. Using a random forest model we were able to predict the resistance or susceptibility of bacteria with 85-90\% accuracy, with a 30-50\% reduction in overall isolate length, and an 80-90\% reduction in the feature space over baseline. Significant contributions were built upon previous analysis of similar data.

- title: "Stationary Exercise Classification using IMUs and Deep Learning"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: In the current market, successful fitness tracking devices utilize heart rate and GPS to determine performance. These devices are useful, but don't extensively classify stationary exercise. This paper proposes a modern approach for tuning and investigating optimal neural network types on stationary exercises using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). Using three IMUs located on the ankle, waist, and wrist, data is collected to map the body as it moves during the stationary physical activity. A novel five-stage deep learning tuning system was written and deployed to classify user movement as one of three classes air squats, jumping jacks, and kettlebell swings. It was determined that the ConvLSTM2D type is the most accurate and second fastest for training stationary exercise classification. Tracking of human movement extends to realms outside of fitness such as robotics, medical and military applications.

- title: "Predicting Premature Birth Risk with cfRNA"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: Identifying which genes are early indicators for preterm births using cell-free ribonucleic acid (cfRNA) from non-invasive blood tests provided by pregnant women can improve prenatal care. Currently, there are no medical tests for early detection of preterm birth risk in routine checkups for pregnant women. Recent studies have shown potential genes that can predict preterm birth. Machine learning techniques are utilized to see if the Area Under the Curve (AUC) can be improved upon when evaluating the prediction accuracy for chosen genes sequences and concentrations. Using cell-free RNA data from non-invasive blood tests in conjunction with machine learning, we improve upon the current methodology in an effort to identify and provide evidence between gene expression data and preterm birth. In our analysis, the model accuracy is improved using cfRNA Sequence Counts by expanding the feature space in which we have increased model AUC from 81% to 100%. These results are intended to provide additional evidence of model validity as an early indicator of preterm birth.

- title: "Automated Pleural Effusion Detection on Chest X-Rays"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: In this paper we present a lightweight solution to help identify a pathological condition called Pleural Effusion using chest x-rays (CXR). Patients with Pleural Effusion have been found to have increased mortality rates, and if left undiagnosed effusion has been found to contribute to congestive heart failure, malignancy, pulmonary embolism, and tuberculosis [15][13]. Using convolutional neural network architectures we developed a model to assist in the successful diagnosis of Pleural Effusion. The effectiveness of our model was evaluated against 200 studies manually labeled by consensus from 3 board certified radiologist. We demonstrate that our model is able to reproduce current baseline performance for this task with a model that is 10x smaller and 30x faster. This lighter architecture allows for more flexibility in deployment including the ability to deploy directly on an edge node. We present this model as a tool for the radiologists to diagnose the presence of Pleural Effusion from a diagnostic imaging study.
